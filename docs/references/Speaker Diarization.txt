## Enable Feature

To enable Diarization, use the following parameter in the query string when you call Deepgram’s `/listen` endpoint :

`diarize=true`

To transcribe audio from a file on your computer, run the following cURL command in a terminal or your favorite API client.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl \
    --request POST \
    --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
    --header 'Content-Type: audio/wav' \
    --data-binary @youraudio.wav \
    --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?diarize=true'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Replace `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your [Deepgram API Key](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys).
</Warning>

## Analyze Response

<Info>
  For this example, we use an MP3 audio file that contains the beginning of a customer call with Premier Phone Services. If you would like to follow along, you can [download it](https://res.cloudinary.com/deepgram/video/upload/v1680127025/dg-audio/nasa-spacewalk-interview_ljjahn.wav).
</Info>

When the file is finished processing, you’ll receive a JSON response. Let's look more closely at the `words` object within the `alternatives` object within this response.

### Pre-Recorded

When using diarization for pre-recorded audio, both `speaker` and `speaker_confidence` values will be returned:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
  ...
  "alternatives":[
    {
      ...
      "words": [
        {
          "word":"hello",
          "start":15.259043,
          "end":15.338787,
          "confidence":0.9721591,
          "speaker":0,
          "speaker_confidence":0.5853265
        },
      ...
      ]
    }
  ]
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Live Streaming

When using diarization for live streaming audio, only the `speaker` value will be returned:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
  ...
  "alternatives":[
    {
      ...
      "words": [
        {
          "word":"hello",
          "start":15.259043,
          "end":15.338787,
          "confidence":0.9721591,
          "speaker":0
        },
      ...
      ]
    }
  ]
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Format Response

To improve readability, you can use a JSON processor to parse the JSON. In this example, we use [JQ](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) and further improve readability by turning on Deepgram’s [punctuation](/docs/punctuation/) and [utterances](/docs/utterances/) features:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl \
    --request POST \
    --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?diarize=true&punctuate=true&utterances=true' \
    --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
    --header 'content-type: audio/mp3' \
    --data-binary @Premier_broken-phone_numbers.mp3 | jq -r ".results.utterances[] | \"[Speaker:\(.speaker)] \(.transcript)\""
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Replace `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your [Deepgram API Key](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys).
</Warning>

When the file is finished processing, you’ll receive the following response:

```
[Speaker:0] Hello, and thank you for calling premier phone service. Please be aware that this call may be recorded for quality and training purposes.
[Speaker:0] My name is Beth, and I will be assisting you today. How are you doing?
[Speaker:1] Not too bad. How are you today?
[Speaker:0] I'm doing well. Thank you. May I please have your name?
[Speaker:1] My name is Blake...
```
